## How to set up site
To get started with this site, you would need to install SASS. Firstly, ensure you have GIT and node installed, then clone the repository onto your computer, open the folder and right click and select GUI bash here. Once the command line has opened type:
```
npm install -g sass
```
After this, on the command line type:
```
npm run sass-watch
```
This will ensure that whilst you edit the SASS it'll update the stylesheet. Press Ctrl-C to stop.

As this site uses php, it can not be tested in a browser like HTML, where you can drag and drop the file onto the browser. Instead, a web server is needed to view the site. XAMPP is a cross platform web server which can be used to view this site, othe roptions are MAMPP (only for Mac) OR WAMPP (only for windows) along with many others. To use this, simply install XAMPP and clone the repository into the htdocs folder which can be found in the XAMPP folder on your computer. Then, open up XAMPP control panel and pres start for Apache, MySQL, FileZilla and Mercury. Then once these have started, go to you browser and type:
```
localhost/eleanormorgan-portfolio
```
Followed by whichever page you wish to view.
